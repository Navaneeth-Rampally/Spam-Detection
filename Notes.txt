Project Title
Spam Detection and Fake User Identification on Twitter

1. "I developed a machine learning application that automatically detects fake user accounts and spam tweets on Twitter by analyzing user behavior and content patterns."

2. The Problem Statement (Why you did it)
Issue: Social media platforms are flooded with automated bots and spam accounts that spread misinformation and lower platform quality.

Goal: To build a robust system that can classify users as "Fake" or "Real" and tweets as "Spam" or "Non-Spam" with high accuracy.

3. Technical Approach (How it works)
Input Data: I used a Twitter dataset (JSON format) containing user profile details (followers, following, reputation) and tweet text.

Feature Extraction: I didn't just look at text; I looked at behavioral features:

Reputation Score: The ratio of followers to following (Fake users often follow many but have few followers).

Engagement: Number of retweets, replies, and hashtags.

Content: I used NLP (Natural Language Processing) to analyze tweet text for spam keywords.

Algorithms Used: I implemented and compared four distinct algorithms to find the best performer:

Random Forest: Used for its robustness in handling multiple features.

Naive Bayes: The industry standard for text-based spam filtering.

SVM (Support Vector Machine): Good for separating complex data points.

ELM (Extreme Learning Machine): A neural network-based algorithm I implemented for high speed and efficiency.

4. Key Results & Innovation

Comparison Engine: The system doesn't just run one model; it runs all four and generates a comparative accuracy graph.

Proposed Solution: I highlighted ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) as a proposed solution because it offers faster training times compared to traditional neural networks while maintaining high accuracy.


User Interface: I built a full GUI using Tkinter to make the tool accessible to non-technical users, featuring a dashboard to view real-time prediction calculations.


5. Tools & Technologies
Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn (Machine Learning), Pandas (Data Management), NumPy (Math), Matplotlib (Graphs).

GUI: Tkinter (for the Desktop Interface).

6. Potential Interview Questions (Cheat Sheet)
Q: How did you decide if a user is "Fake"?

A: I implemented a logic based on "Reputation." If a user follows a huge number of people but has very few followers (e.g., following 2000, followers 10), the system flags them as suspicious/fake. 


Q: How did you handle the text data?


A: I used CountVectorizer (Bag of Words) to convert the raw text of the tweets into numerical vectors that the machine learning models could understand. 


Q: Why did you use multiple algorithms?

A: No single algorithm is perfect for every dataset. By comparing four, I could objectively demonstrate which one offered the best balance of precision and recall for this specific data.
